## **NRSSH Results**

The eigenvalues for the NRSSH Hamiltonian were plotted in $k$-space, in the first Brillouin zone.
As the model's Hamiltonian is independent of $k$, we plot two sets of eigenenergies (red and blue) to fully visualise the bands.
Below is a plot for the NRSSH lattice in the topologically-insulating phase.

In the plot above, there are two isolated states with onsite energy in the band gap - these are the edge modes.
These edge modes have the corresponding eigenvector below:

Here, the bulk-boundary correspondence is clear.
The photons are entirely on the edges of the lattice, diminishing in intensity going further into the bulk.

### NRSSH Findings

**Phase Behavior Discovery**
- Discovered 1st-order phase transitions leading to chaotic regimes when gain saturation mediates prominent nonlinearities.
- Mapped lasing threshold discontinuities influenced by system parameters.

**Temporal Dynamics**
- Revealed irregular chaotic behavior with hyper-sensitivity to initial conditions.
- Demonstrated that chaotic phases correspond to oscillating phases.

### Diamond Findings

**Complex Phase Structure**
- Uncovered additional phase types beyond the NRSSH model, including mixed phases.
- Identified exclusive stable phases in face-dimerized systems with higher final times compared to lossy stable regions.
- Found that only saturated systems without neighboring-dimerization can enter chaotic phases.

**Critical Phase Transitions**
- Documented both 1st-order and 2nd-order phase transitions between stable and chaotic phases.
- Discovered non-linear phase transition curves.
- Identified critical points where phase transition curves gradually shift from 1st-order to 2nd-order behavior.
