# Results

## **NRSSH Findings**

**Phase Behavior Discovery**
- Discovered 1st-order phase transitions leading to chaotic regimes when gain saturation mediates prominent nonlinearities.
- Mapped lasing threshold discontinuities influenced by system parameters.

**Temporal Dynamics**
- Revealed irregular chaotic behavior with hyper-sensitivity to initial conditions.
- Demonstrated that chaotic phases correspond to oscillating phases.

## **Diamond Findings**

**Complex Phase Structure**
- Uncovered additional phase types beyond the NRSSH model, including mixed phases.
- Identified exclusive stable phases in face-dimerized systems with higher final times compared to lossy stable regions.
- Found that only saturated systems without neighboring-dimerization can enter chaotic phases.

**Critical Phase Transitions**
- Documented both 1st-order and 2nd-order phase transitions between stable and chaotic phases.
- Discovered non-linear phase transition curves.
- Identified critical points where phase transition curves gradually shift from 1st-order to 2nd-order behavior.
