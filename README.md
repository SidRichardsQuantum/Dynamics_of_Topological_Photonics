# Dynamics of Topological Photonics with Nonlinear Saturable Gain and Loss

This is a revamped version of my dissertation code at Lancaster University, where i worked with Dr Henning Schomerus on topological laser phases, edge modes and numerical simulations.

### In this repo, we study two main lattices:
- The non-reciprocal Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (NRSSH) model with alternating inter and intra-cell hopping strengths, where the left and right intra-cell hoppings are unequal.
- Diamond (Rhombic) model with three sites A, B, C per cell. There are no hoppings between sites B and C, hence this model may be referred to as the "ladder lattice" or something similar. Different combinations of which hoppings are equal form different "dimerizations" - leading to exotic laser phases.
